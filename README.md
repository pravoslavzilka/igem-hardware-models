iGEM 2025 Brno Czech Republic  ‚Äì Hardware 3D Models
===================================

This repository contains the **3D models** used in the hardware solution developed by the **iGEM 2025 Brno Czech Republic team**.The models are shared openly under an open-source license so that anyone can download, study, and build on our designs.

üìÇ Contents
-----------

*   3D models of hardware components designed for our iGEM 2025 project
    
*   Files in standard 3D CAD formats (e.g., .ipt, .stl, .step)

*   Files in standard 2D formats (e.g., .dwg)

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
------------------

*   These files represent **only the 3D-printed parts** of our hardware.
    
*   **They are not sufficient on their own** to fully reproduce the device.
    
*   Additional components (electronics, mechanical parts, assembly instructions, etc.) are required.
    

If you plan to build or adapt our solution, make sure to review the complete project documentation (see links below).

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
---------

1.  git clone [https://github.com/pravoslavzilka/igem-2025-hardware-models.git](https://github.com/pravoslavzilka/igem-hardware-models)
    
2.  Open the models in your preferred CAD software or slicing tool.
    
3.  Print or adapt the models for your DIY build.
